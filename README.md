# :memo: CSES Problem Set Solutions
CSES is one of the best sources of programming tasks. In this repository you can find my solutions that I solve in my free time using TypeScript programming language. I hope that I can create a complete collection of solved problems.

## :rocket: How to run my code?
To run my code on your computer, just clone this repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/cheatsnake/CSES-problem-set-typescript.git
```

Then run the command to install the necessary packages:
```sh
npm install
```

Now just use the `ts-node` command to run any code by specifying the path to it:
```sh
ts-node .\src\IntroductoryProblems\WeirdAlgorithm.ts
```
Thanks to  <b>Node.js readline module</b> all my solutions support data entry from the console.
